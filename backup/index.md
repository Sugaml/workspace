# Kubernetes Backup Index

## Overview
This document serves as an index for Kubernetes backup strategies, tools, and best practices. Ensuring that your Kubernetes cluster is backed up is essential for disaster recovery, data integrity, and seamless migrations.

## Backup Strategies
1. **Full Cluster Backup** – Backup all Kubernetes objects, configurations, and persistent volumes.
2. **Namespace-Specific Backup** – Backup only selected namespaces for granular recovery.
3. **Persistent Volume Backup** – Ensure data stored in persistent volumes is included in backups.
4. **Application-Level Backup** – Use application-specific methods (e.g., database dumps) alongside Kubernetes backups.

## Backup Tools
### 1. Velero
- Open-source tool for backing up and restoring Kubernetes clusters.
- Supports major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Features: Scheduled backups, volume snapshots, disaster recovery.

### 2. Stash
- Backup and restore Kubernetes workloads using Restic.
- Supports multiple storage providers.
- Focused on database and application backups.

### 3. Kasten K10
- Enterprise-grade backup and disaster recovery solution.
- Provides ransomware protection and automated policies.
- Supports multi-cloud environments.

### 4. TrilioVault for Kubernetes
- Policy-driven backups for Kubernetes applications.
- Works with cloud-native storage solutions.

## Best Practices
- **Automate Backups** – Use scheduled backups to ensure consistency.
- **Encrypt and Secure** – Protect backups using encryption and access controls.
- **Test Restores Regularly** – Validate recovery procedures to avoid surprises.
- **Store Offsite Copies** – Use cloud storage or remote locations for redundancy.
- **Monitor and Alert** – Set up notifications for backup failures or inconsistencies.

## Backup Configuration Example (Velero)
### Install Velero
```sh
velero install \
    --provider aws \
    --bucket kubernetes-backups \
    --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
    --use-volume-snapshots=true \
    --backup-location-config region=us-west-2
```

### Create a Backup
```sh
velero backup create full-cluster-backup --include-namespaces '*' --ttl 72h
```

### Restore a Backup
```sh
velero restore create --from-backup full-cluster-backup
```

## Conclusion
Choosing the right backup tool and strategy for your Kubernetes environment ensures data resilience and operational continuity. Regular testing and monitoring of backups are crucial to a robust disaster recovery plan.
